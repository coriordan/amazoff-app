This comprehensive guide takes the worldwide shift to smartphones and tablets into account.  New information includes discussions on mobile apps, touch interfaces, screen size considerations, and more. The new full\u2013color interior and unique layout better illustrate modern design concepts. \r\n\r\nThe interaction design profession is blooming with the success of design\u2013intensive companies, priming customers to expect \"design\" as a critical ingredient of marketplace success.
